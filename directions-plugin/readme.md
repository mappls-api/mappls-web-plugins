1. Copy and paste the generated `access token` from your API [keys](https://apis.mappls.com/console/) available in the dashboard in the sample code for interactive map development.
    - This APIs follow OAuth2 based security.
    - `Access Token` can be generated using Token Generation API.
    - To know more on how to create your access tokens, please use our authorization API URL. More details available [here](https://about.mappls.com/api/advanced-maps/doc/authentication-api.php)
    - The `access token` is a valid by default for 24 hours from the time of generation. This can be configured by you in the API console.
2. The sample codes are provided on our domain to help you understand the very basic functionality of Mappls Direction Plugin. [See Sample Codes here](https://about.mappls.com/api/web-sdk/vector-plugin-example/Direction/mappls-direction-plugin)

## Introduction to Directions Plugin

This plugin, offered by Mappls Plugins for Web, uses integrated places searches for directions for several modes of transportation, including driving, biking and walking.

The plugin offers the following basic functionalities:

1. Integrated support of Mappls(MapmyIndia) Place search for searching locations of origin, destinations and via points.
2. It allows to use origin and destinations in Mappls's digital address (semicolon separated) eLoc or WGS 84 geographical coordinates both.
3.  The ability to set the vehicle profile like driving, biking,trucking and walking.
4. Easily set the resource for traffic and ETA information.


For details, please contact apisupport@mappls.com.
